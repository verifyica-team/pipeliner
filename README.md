# Verifyica Pipeliner

Verifyica Pipeliner allows you to define and run a local pipeline using a syntax ***similar*** to GitHub actions.

**Pipeliner is not designed to be 100% GitHub Action compatible.**

## Why ?

There are many scenarios where you need to perform various processing steps during development, system maintenance, or general workflows.

Example:

- patching source files
- setting up a test environment
- building a custom zip or tar.gz file
- common local CI/CD workflows
- system maintenance tasks

#### Maven & Gradle

Maven and Gradle ***can*** and ***are*** useful in development environment for Java developers.

Developers in other languages use non-Java language specific tools.

Maven and Gradle are not the best tools for system administrators.

#### Bash

A common go to is to use a Bash script(s). Pipeliner uses them for testing.

Implementing logging, exit code checking, etc. is commonly implemented incorrectly and inconsistently.

#### Pipeliner

Pipeliner allows a declarative definition of a pipeline(s) using YAML. The exit code of each command is checked, and the pipeline is aborted if a command fails.

Designing a pipeline(s) using Bash command(s), small purpose-built applications, or small purpose-built shell scripts allows for easier development, reuse, testing, etc.

## Requirements

- Linux
- Java 8 or later

## Installation

### Installation Script

Download and run the installation script.

Install the latest version:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verifyica-team/pipeliner/main/install.sh | bash
```

Install a specific version:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verifyica-team/pipeliner/main/install.sh | bash -s -- <release>
```

**Notes**

- The installation script requires
  - curl
  - tar
  - jq

### Manual Installation

Download the zip or tar.gz file from the [releases](https://github.com/verifyica-team/pipeliner/releases)

Zip:

```bash
cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
unzip verifyica-pipeliner.zip
./pipeliner --info
```

Tarball:

```bash
cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
tar -xf verifyica-pipeliner.tar.gz
./pipeliner --info
```

# Usage

Usage is similar to GitHub actions, but not 100% compatible.

The easiest way to get started is to look at the [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) guide.

# Building

Java 8 or later is required to build. The code target is Java 8.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verifyica-team/CLI
cd CLI
./mvnw clean verify
```

## Packaging

The `OUTPUT` directory will contain the release packages and associated SHA1 checksum files.

- `install.sh`
- `install.sh.sha1`
- `verifiyica-piperliner.zip`
- `verifiyica-piperliner.zip.sha1`
- `verifyica-piperliner.tar.gz`
- `verifyica-piperliner.tar.gz.sha1`

**Notes**

- Packaging requires `zip` and `tar` to be installed
