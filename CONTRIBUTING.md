Code source code targets Java 8.

The project uses an GitHub Flow branching strategy.

- `main` branch for active development / unreleased code
- `release-<VERSION>` branch for a releases
- [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) is used to apply [Palantir Java Format](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format)

- Expand all Java imports
- Tags are used for releases

For changes, you should...

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your work off of `main`

- Build and test your changes
- Open a pull request targeting `main`, tagging `@antublue` for review
